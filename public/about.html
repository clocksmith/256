  <p>
    Ahoy hoy! I'm clocksmith (a LAN party name that stuck from my early days
    online), and that is now my handle on GitHub and other platforms.

    is my primary online presence beyond standard social media. Here, I'll be
    sharing a mix of news analysis, tech speculation, practical how-tos, and
    other creative content. I'll clearly note any content created or
    significantly assisted by AI.
